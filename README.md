known issues:
- obsidian has a known issue of a misalignment between the checkbox and text. 
  this should be fixed in the next release, so i'm holding off on fixing any misalignment
  issues until then.
- rotated svgs do not show as rotated on iOS/iPadOS. i don't have a fix for this.


to do:
- update color assignations for possible cross-theming
