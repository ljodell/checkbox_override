~ checkbox_override.css ~

 ~ an obsidian snippet ~

an update and expansion 
on available checkboxes 
    themed to match 
deathau's 80s neon theme

thanks to:
- deathau for the fantastic theme
- relkion for plotting checkboxes
- den for futuristic checkboxes
- svgrepo

known issues:
- obsidian has a known issue of a misalignment between the checkbox and text. 
  this should be fixed in the next release, so i'm holding off on fixing any misalignment
  issues until then.

to do:
- update color assignations for possible cross-theming
